# Google_Foobar_Challenges
Recently I have got invited from google foobar challenges. I am currently now in `Level 4`.<br>
The problems I faced so far was basically algorithm releted and some gave me such hard time solving them.<br>

## Level 1
`Level 1` contains one problem. The problem I faced in this level titled `The Cake is not a Lie`<br>
This problem was pretty straight cut problem.<br>
